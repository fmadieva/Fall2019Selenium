Today is March 11, 2020

Agenda: Git

git pull, fetch, merge, clone

Windows, use git bash or powershell, not a CMD/


Terminal commands:

ls - to list directory

ls -a / ls -l to see all files, even hidden

pwd - print work directory

cd folderName - switch to another folder

mkdir foldername - make directory

mkdir git - you will create a git folder

cd .. - go back

######### git commands are the same for everyone

To get a copy of the project, use git clone URL

For example:

git clone https://github.com/CybertekSchool/GitPracticeFall2019.git

For windows: run git bash as administrator

right click on the program --> run as administrator


for mac: run command with sudo

Instead of:

git clone https://github.com/CybertekSchool/GitPracticeFall2019.git

USe sudo:

sudo git clone https://github.com/CybertekSchool/GitPracticeFall2019.git


IF you want to delete some file through the terminal?

rm name of the file/folder

rm GitPracticeFall2019 - to delete project that I've just cloned

WARNING!

rm -f file - force removal, don't use it if you are not sure!

rm -rf folder/filename - remove forcefully

clear - to clean the terminal
